//Cloud Concepts Overview;
Cloud computing refers to the on-demand availability of computer system resources, particularly data storage and computational power, without the user's direct active supervision. Large clouds frequently have functions distributed across numerous locations, each of which is a data center. To accomplish coherence, cloud computing relies on resource sharing and often employs a "pay-as-you-go" approach, which can help reduce capital expenses but may also result in unanticipated running expenses for users.
//Cloud Economics, Billing & Support;
The utility of the cloud extends beyond the lowering of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). AWS clients also report considerable increases in employee productivity, operational resilience, and business agility.
//Cloud Global Infrastructure;
On-premises cloud infrastructure is a cloud computing term that appears to contravene a core tenet of cloud services, namely that cloud services are often supplied off-site as a fundamental aspect of cloud technology architecture. On-premises cloud infrastructure refers to cloud-related hardware that is located on-site at the client's actual business location and is related to cloud services or activities.
//Cloud Security;
Cloud security, in a nutshell, provides support and security to apps, infrastructure, and procedures, as well as protecting data from vulnerable assaults. Cloud security arose as a result of the huge architecture of cloud computing systems that operate online and require daily maintenance.
//Networking & Content Delivery;
Content Delivery Networks supplement the end-to-end transport network by distributing intelligent apps that use strategies meant to maximize content delivery. Web caching, server load balancing, request routing, and content services are all used in the resulting closely integrated overlay.
//Compute;
The term "compute" in cloud computing refers to concepts and things linked to software computation. It is a catch-all word for the processing power, memory, networking, storage, and other resources required for a program's computational success.
Applications that perform machine learning algorithms or 3D graphics rendering tasks, for example, require many gigabytes of RAM and multiple CPUs to function well. In this situation, the CPUs, RAM, and Graphic Processing Units necessary are referred to as compute resources, and the applications are compute-intensive.
//Storage;
Cloud storage is divided into three services on the AWS platform: Service for Simple Storage (S3). Basic object storage that makes data available via an API accessible via the Internet. Storage of Elastic Blocks (EBS). Storage at the block level designed for use by a single VM. Elastic File System (EFS) (EFS).
//Databases;
A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and retrieved electronically in computing. Small databases can be kept on a file system, whereas large databases are kept on computer clusters or in the cloud.
//Cloud Architecture;
Cloud architecture is the infrastructure that supports a cloud computing network and enables it to perform its duties when users invoke it. Elements of a cloud architecture address the entire range of requirements for users and systems within the cloud computing network, including both software and hardware, as well as front- and back-end technologies.
//Automatic Scaling & Monitoring;
Instrumentation and monitoring systems at the application, service, and infrastructure levels are generally included in an autoscaling plan. Response times, queue lengths, CPU use, and memory consumption are all captured by these systems.
